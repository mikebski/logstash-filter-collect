## Installation

To install from rubygems.org:

    bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-collect

If you'd like to build locally, you should clone the repo and run:

    bundle install
    gem build logstash-filter-collect.gemspec
    bin/logstash-plugin install --local ./logstash-filter-collect-1.0.0.gem
    
Make sure that the argument is the correct filename 
(the gem that `gem build` creates) since the version might be different

## Usage

This plugin takes a list of objects in your event and turns it into a 
list of strings.  The original purpose of this was to take something like this:

     lop => [{ 'person' => {'id' => 12, 'name' => 'Mike'} }, {'person' => {'id' => 13, 'name' => 'Sam'}}]

and turn it into a list like this:

    names => ['Mike', 'Sam']
    
With this filter plugin, the following configuration will do that:
    
    collect => {
        'field' => 'people', 
        'property' => ['person' 'name'], 
        'collection' => 'names'
    }
